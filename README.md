# Gatekeeper

A collection of programs for controlling subprocesses on Linux and related operating systems.

Each module is available as a stand-alone binary, which will either `fork` and `execve`, or apply its mitigation and `execve` directly to the next in the chain.

Each module is also available as a library, which can be compiled into a larger, monolithic binary.

## Requirements

```
apt-get -y install make gcc libpcre3-dev libcap-dev libpcap-dev libseccomp-dev
```

## Building

You can use `clang` or `gcc`.

```
make
make CC=clang-3.5
```

You can also build a specific project.

```
cd src/chroot
make
```

### Cross-Compiling

Just specify the name of the target.  You must have an appropriate compiler toolchain installed.

```
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

## Testing

Requires [`bats`](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats).

```
make test
```

## Chaining Modules

The modules are designed to be included in a larger project, or chained directly.  For example:

```sh
$ ./blacklist/blacklist \
  ./pcap/pcap foo.pcap \
  ./alarm/alarm 10 \
  ./got_nobind/got_nobind \
  ./malloc/malloc \
  ./no_network/no_network \
  ./randenv/randenv \
  ./rlimit_cpu/rlimit_cpu 5 \
  ./rlimit_fsize/rlimit_fsize 0 \
  ./rlimit_nproc/rlimit_nproc 0 \
  ./segv/segv MYSEGV \
  ./setpgid/setpgid \
  ./setsid/setsid \
  /usr/bin/env LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/ldfuck/ldfuck.so $PWD/no_execve/no_execve.so" \
  /bin/sh
```

## Modules

Here's a short descrption of each module.  To build a module, just run `make` in its directory.

- [`alarm`](src/alarm/README.md) - Kills the process and all of its children with `SIGALRM` after a period of time
- [`blacklist`](src/blacklist/README.md) - Blocks connections from blacklisted IP/IPv6 address ranges, by inspecting `getpeername` on stdin, stdout, stderr.
- [`chroot`](src/chroot/README.md) - Does what it says on the tin.
- [`delay`](src/delay/README.md) - Adds in a time delay after every proxied `read` or `write`
- [`devctf`](src/devctf/README.md) - Hooks calls to `open` to catch `open("/dev/ctf",...)` and returns a pre-determined file descriptor.  This allows access to `/dev/ctf` from within a chroot.
- [`got_bind`](src/got_bind/README.md) - Forces the GOT to bind immediately
- [`got_nobind`](src/got_nobind/README.md) - Prevents the GOT from binding, which prevents ASLR defeats by leaking the GOT
- [`inotify_child`](src/inotify_child/README.md) - Watches only its own child process, and inspects its file table (via `SIGSTOP` and `/proc/.../fd`) to see if any handles are open.
- [`inotify`](src/inotify/README.md) - Watches for events on a specific file, and kills all children (in a new process group) on an event.
- [`ldfuck`](src/ldfuck/README.md) - Fucks with internal linker structures which are used to leak function addresses over-the-wire.
- [`malloc`](src/malloc/README.md) - Sets environment variables understood by glibc and eglibc, which cause `malloc`ed memory to be initialized to a pattern, and `free`ed memory to be overwritten with a pattern.  Useful for heap leaks/UAFs.
- [`no_execve`](src/no_execve/README.md) - Hooks all `exec*` and related (`system`, `popen`) function calls via the PLT.  Also disables `execve` via seccomp-bpf.
- [`no_network`](src/no_network/README.md) - Uses `seccomp` to prevent most socket-related syscalls.
- [`noparent`](src/noparent/README.md) - Performs a double-fork before `execve`ing so that, in the child process, `getppid()` will return `1` (pid of `init`) so that `kill(SIGTERM, getppid())` shellcode is useless.
- [`onepath`](src/onepath/README.md) - Allows `execve` calls, but checks `/proc/self/exe` in the new process to see if it is a specific, permitted path.
- [`openfile`](src/openfile/README.md) - Opens a specific file on a specific file descriptor.
- [`pcap`](src/pcap/README.md) - Captures all stdin/stdout/stderr to a pcap file, with accurate address information gathered from `getpeername`.
- [`proxy`](src/proxy/README.md) - Communications forwarding template and hook library.  Ideally suited to only performing a single copy of stdin/stdout/stderr instead of multiple copies between various consumers.
- [`randenv`](src/randenv/README.md) - Adds a random-length environment variable to the environment, which should modify offsets on the stack.
- [`regex`](src/regex/README.md) - I/O filtering based on regular expressions
- [`rlimit_cpu`](src/rlimit_cpu/README.md) - Adds CPU time limits to all subprocesses
- [`rlimit_fsize`](src/rlimit_fsize/README.md) - Adds limits on the size of file which may be created
- [`rlimit_nproc`](src/rlimit_nproc/README.md) - Effectively prevents child processes from `fork`ing.
- [`segv`](src/segv/README.md) - Installs a `SIGSEGV` handler library, which will dump stack traces to a file.  Requires `libSegFault.so` from `libsegfault`.
- [`setpgid`](src/setpgid/README.md) - Spawns the child in a new process group.  All of its descendants can be easily killed with `kill(SIGTERM, -pid)`.
- [`setsid`](src/setsid/README.md) - Spawns the child in a new session.
- [`signal`](src/signal/README.md) - Masks off all signals.  May interfere with `segv` and `alarm` modules.
- [`unbuffer`](src/unbuffer/README.md) - Effectively disables libc buffering of stdout in the child by creating a pseudo-terminal (PTY) as its stdout (instead of a pipe).
- [`unsocket`](src/unsocket/README.md) - Turns all `send` and `recv` calls, which only work on sockets, into `write` and `read` calls, which work just fine on sockets, files, or pipes.

Zach - I'm a developer working for a company who does Anti-Tamper/Cyber security and other cool things. I work with really smart folks. It's one of the few jobs I've had that I love. I came across your gatekeeper-chroot, and thought I might find an application for code development here. Anyhow, looking at the jobs you've had makes me think you would be another awesome addition to our team, so I submitted your name and links to our hiring folks who tried to reach out over linked in, but we don't have your email, so here's another attempt! I'd appreciate hearing back if you are interested.. or not. Also, although I've given you credit for the chroot code, you don't have a license, so it would be nice to know if/how you want it marked. doug.springer@idahoscientific.com. Thanks.
